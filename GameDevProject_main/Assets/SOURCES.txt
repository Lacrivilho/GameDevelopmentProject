Foshan-Factory-Fabric-Staff-Office-Chair-Full-Set-Chairs-Parts.png is from a google search, unfortunately I did not write down what website.
Then again, it seems the company's name is in the file-name.

kindpng_418143.png I've had on my PC for probably half a decade now, no idea where I got it from. Judging by the file-name possibly a site called kindpng.
This was also used in some of the UI elements.

-All other textures are self made, as well as all 3D models.

Since Unity's decal system is not available in built-in render pipeline and the projector system is extremely outdated, I've had to use This:
https://github.com/EricFreeman/DynamicDecals
It is referneced again in the relevant folder.

I also modified and used a bullet impact and muzzle-flash particle effect from Unity's Particle Pack:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/p/particle-pack-127325
This includes the relevant materials.

As for the code, I followed a number of tutorials, mainly these:

I might have reused some of their code, but always modified and reworked it to fit my own purposes and scenes, so it wasn't just copied.
I also used ChatGPT for general architecture and "How do I do this thing in Unity" kind of questions, as well as bugfixing, but also 
not straight for writing code. All code was written out by me.

I think that's it, I hope I haven't forgotten anything. If I did, I apologize, it was an honest mistake and not an attempt to cheat.
